* A Sex and Gender Resource Directory

This is a [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel/blob/main/Devel/loel-lists.org][Resource Directory]] of the [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel#readme][League of Extraordinary Learners
(LOEL)]].

This repository intended as a repository for high-quality materials
which people interested in the Biological, Psychological, Social and
possibly other aspects of Sex and Gender may find useful in learning
more about these subjects.

In addition to links to informational media, there are outlines and
design information for some workshops on the subject.

This repository could transform into a curriculum if these and
supplemental materials were to form learning pathways.
