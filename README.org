* A Sex and Gender Resource Directory

This is a [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel/blob/main/Devel/loel-lists.org][Resource Directory]] of the [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel#readme][League of Extraordinary Learners
(LOEL)]].

This is a repository for high-quality materials relevant to the
Biological, Psychological, Social and possibly other aspects of Sex
and Gender suitable for people interested in learning more about these
subjects.  We would love your assistance in accumulating more
of such resources!

In addition to informational media, there are outlines and design
information for some workshops on this domain.

This repository could transform into a curriculum if these and
supplemental materials were to form learning pathways.
