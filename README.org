* A Sex and Gender Resource Directory

This is a [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel/blob/main/Devel/loel-lists.org][Resource Directory]] of the [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel#readme][League of Extraordinary Learners
(LOEL)]].

This is a repository for high-quality materials in the Biological,
Psychological, Social and possibly other aspects of Sex and Gender
suitable for people interested in learning more about these subjects.
We would love your assistance in accumulating more resources!

In addition to links to informational media, there are outlines and
design information for some workshops on the subject.

This repository could transform into a curriculum if these and
supplemental materials were to form learning pathways.
